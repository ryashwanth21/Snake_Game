# Snake Game

A simple Snake Game created using the Pygame library in Python. In this game, the player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding walls and the snake's own body.

## Features

- **Classic Snake Gameplay**: Control the snake with arrow keys.
- **Score Tracking**: The score increases as the snake eats food.
- **Increasing Speed**: The snake's speed gradually increases as it grows longer.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if the snake hits the walls or its own body.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

### Install Pygame

You can install the Pygame library using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## How to Play

1. **Starting the Game**:
   - The game starts with a snake in the middle of the screen.
   - Use the arrow keys (`Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`) to move the snake.

2. **Eating Food**:
   - The snake moves towards food, represented by a black square.
   - The snake grows longer with each food it eats.

3. **Game Over**:
   - The game ends if the snake touches the boundary of the screen or if it collides with its own body.

4. **Score**:
   - The score increases by 1 each time the snake eats food. The current score is displayed at the top left corner of the screen.

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys**:
  - **Up Arrow**: Move the snake up.
  - **Down Arrow**: Move the snake down.
  - **Left Arrow**: Move the snake left.
  - **Right Arrow**: Move the snake right.

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/snake-game.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd snake-game
```

3. Install the required dependencies (Pygame):

```bash
pip install pygame
```

4. Run the game:

python Snake_Game.py
```

## Game Loop

The game consists of the following basic components:

- **Initialization**: Initializes Pygame and sets up the game window and variables.
- **Game Loop**: Keeps running the game until the player loses. The game loop handles user input, updates the snake's position, checks for collisions, and handles scoring.
- **Snake Growth**: The snake grows in length each time it eats food.
- **Speed Increase**: The snake's speed increases gradually as it grows longer.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if the snake hits the wall or itself.
